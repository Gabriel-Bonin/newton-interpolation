# Polynomial Interpolation Algorithm

## Summary
Polynomial interpolation is a method of estimating values between known data points. The Newton's method for polynomial interpolation is useful since there is no need to solve a system of linear equations. Besides, it is a low computational cost model and given n points it generates a polynomium of (n-1) order at most [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial).

The code here was used in a project for the Brazilian Navy, when I was part of Quanta Jr [2] (https://www.quanta.org.br/). This is a general code since the data used cannot be shared.
